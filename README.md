- 👋 Hi, I’m @TheGlassPenguin
- 👀 I’m interested in programming, photography and the outdoors.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript, Scratch 3, Python, basics of photography, and I'm in the middle of a biology class.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything, really.
- 📫 How to reach me: Feel free to contact me on my Scratch account's profile comments. Here's the link: https://scratch.mit.edu/users/TheGlassPenguin/
